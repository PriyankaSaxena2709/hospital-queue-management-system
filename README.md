# HOSPITAL QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Full-stack web app enhancing outpatient efficiency by automating patient queues and real-time updates using mern stack and socket.io

---

## Introduction

In traditional hospitals and clinics, patients often face long waiting times, confusion about their position in the queue and frequent mismanagement due to the lack of real-time updates. This leads to frustration for patients and inefficiency for doctors who struggle to manage their schedules effectively. 

The **Hospital Queue Management** System aims to solve this problem by digitizing the patient queue. Patients can easily select a department, choose an available doctor, and instantly receive a token number. The system provides real-time updates on the queue status, including the current token being served and estimated waiting time. Doctors, on the other hand, get a clear view of their patient queue and can efficiently manage it by marking patients as attended or not attended. 
By streamlining the process, the system reduces waiting room chaos, improves patient satisfaction, and enhances overall hospital efficiency.
